/**
 * <p>
 *  In mathematics, a linear equation is an equation that may be put in the form
 *  <br />
 *      ax + b = 0
 *  <br />
 *  where x is the variable (or unknown or indeterminate), and a and b are the
 *  coefficients, which are often real numbers. The coefficients may be
 *  considered as parameters of the equation, and may be stated as arbitrary
 *  expressions, restricted to not contain any of the variables.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *  To yield a meaningful equation for non-zero values of b, the coefficients
 *  are required not to be all zeros.
 * </p>
